# API Documentation in .NET: A Practical Guide

## Introduction

In modern software development, keeping API documentation up-to-date and accessible is a crucial part of maintaining a high-quality developer experience.

This tutorial is designed for .NET developers, with a specific focus on C# projects. It walks through how to document APIs across different architectures — REST, gRPC, and asynchronous messaging using brokers — with a consistent and maintainable approach.

The overall goal of this tutorial is to assist in the generation of standardized API documentation that can be published to a centralized developer portal, Backstage, streamlining internal discovery and consumption of APIs.

### You will learn

- How to generate OpenAPI documentation for REST APIs using Swashbuckle.
- How to document gRPC services for use with tools such as **protobuf-docs**. **CHANGE THIS**
- How to approach documenting asynchronous APIs, such as those using message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
- How to integrate this documentation into Backstage, enabling discoverability across your organization.
  
In each section of this guide, you will find the setup steps for each tool, usage instructions, and code examples. For each use case, you will have available a repository demonstrating the use of the tool, to which we will reference throughout the guide.
