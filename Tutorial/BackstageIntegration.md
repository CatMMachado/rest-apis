# Notes for the section

- Throughout the tutorial, we have been talkong about what will be visible in Wagger UI, however it's also relevant to discuss what will be seen in Backstage.
  - Example: Rate limiting. In the actual specification, the only information pertaining to the rate limiting is what is written in the names and descriptions. But the rate limiting will be exercized when accessing the endpoint, bith in Swagger UI and Backstage.
- Information to add in this section:
  - The files necessary to integrate with Backstage, their content and where to put them
    - We have to add theses files to the repository, if SGRE's decision is that the teams should NOT use the dedicated repository for the API docs
  - The information on who to contact to have their repository found by Backstage
